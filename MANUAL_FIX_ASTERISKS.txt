MANUAL FIX FOR PRODUCTS WITH ASTERISKS IN SKUs
=============================================

Since the asterisk (*) character is causing issues with Firebase CLI commands,
here's how to fix these manually in the Firebase Console:

1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/taquotes/database/taquotes-default-rtdb/data/products

2. Fix these 19 products by renaming their keys (remove the asterisk):

   TGF-72SDH*-N    →  TGF-72SDH-N
   TGF-35SDH*-N    →  TGF-35SDH-N
   TGM-15SDH*-N6   →  TGM-15SDH-N6
   TGM-35SDH*-N    →  TGM-35SDH-N
   TGM-72SDH*-N    →  TGM-72SDH-N
   TGF-23SDH*-N    →  TGF-23SDH-N
   TGM-47SD*-N     →  TGM-47SD-N
   TGF-47SDH*-N    →  TGF-47SDH-N
   TGM-15SD*-N6    →  TGM-15SD-N6
   TGM-47SDH*-N    →  TGM-47SDH-N
   TGM-23SDH*-N6   →  TGM-23SDH-N6
   TGM-5SD*-N6     →  TGM-5SD-N6
   TGM-72SD*-N     →  TGM-72SD-N
   TGM-20SD*-N6    →  TGM-20SD-N6
   TGM-7SD*-N6     →  TGM-7SD-N6
   TGM-35SD*-N     →  TGM-35SD-N
   TGM-12SD*-N6    →  TGM-12SD-N6
   TGM-23SD*-N6    →  TGM-23SD-N6
   TGM-10SD*-N6    →  TGM-10SD-N6

3. For each product:
   a. Click on the product with asterisk (e.g., TGF-72SDH*-N)
   b. Click the three dots menu → Export JSON (save it as backup)
   c. Delete the product (three dots menu → Delete)
   d. Click the + button next to "products"
   e. Enter the clean name without asterisk (e.g., TGF-72SDH-N)
   f. Import the JSON you exported
   g. Edit the "sku" field to also remove the asterisk

This will ensure the thumbnail system works properly since the folder names 
don't have asterisks.
